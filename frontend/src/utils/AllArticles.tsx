          One of the first signs of a miscarriage is the moment you discover
          that there is no heartbeat, or there was one and for some reason it
          stopped, or you decide to terminate the pregnancy.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Another sign of miscarriage comes when the body signals through brown
          spotting (old blood) that something is not right. Similar to
          childbirth, miscarriage involves several stages. The pace and nature
          of these stages will vary for each woman. A miscarriage is a natural
          process with predictable phases. You are not alone. To explain and
          describe the processes ahead of you, I developed the active
          miscarriage approach. This approach divides the process into stages,
          allowing you to understand which stage you're in. Each stage is
          supported by tailored assistance.

        <Text>
          This stage often catches you by surprise, bringing a feeling of
          shattered expectations regarding your body, the fetus you were waiting
          for, and the need to adjust to a new reality. It’s important at this
          stage to assess the resources available to you and consider sources of
          emotional and physical support from friends, family, colleagues, or
          professionals. It’s essential to give yourself space for all the
          emotions and feelings that arise within you. Try not to go through the
          process your body and mind are now experiencing alone. For some women,
          sharing can be very challenging, especially if the miscarriage is
          intentional. Find at least one woman or close person who can be with
          you, with whom you will feel supported and safe.

          The Waiting Stage
        </Heading>
        <Text>
          Waiting is an integral part of a natural miscarriage. The body needs
          to balance hormone levels in order to allow for a precise clearing of
          the uterine contents. This stage can be dedicated to saying goodbye to
          the pregnancy, doing emotional work, setting intentions, and
          processing the loss (tools for release and processing can be found in
          the "Tools for Coping" section).

          Many women struggle with staying in the waiting stage, often saying
          things like, "I just need to get this out already," "I’m walking
          around with a dead body in my womb," "I don’t have time for a natural

          The waiting time varies from woman to woman and from miscarriage to

          longer.

        <Text>
          The uncertainty and anticipation are reminiscent of the feelings women
          experience when waiting for childbirth. There is no way to know
          exactly when the body and mind will feel ready and choose the right
          time for the physical emptying of the womb. The waiting period depends
          on the physical state of the body and the hormonal cycle. It is
          important to consider the woman’s emotional state, meaning the release
          of the pregnancy and completion of the farewell process. Just as a due
          date is only an estimate and there is no way to know exactly when
          birth will occur, the timing of a miscarriage cannot be precisely
          determined either. There are holistic and other methods to 'help the
          body' release the pregnancy. Any physical intervention is an
          intervention that may trigger a chain reaction, simply because it
          interferes with a natural process.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Just as we naturally accept that there is a waiting period of about 21
          days between menstrual cycles, so too can there be about 21 days or
          more between the end of the pregnancy and the natural emptying of the
          womb. For some women, the emptying process may be shorter. It is
          similar to how labor can happen in the 40th week or a little before or
          after that time. Each woman has her own timeline for body and mind.
          (For a woman experiencing a second miscarriage, there may be
          differences between the miscarriages, even for the same woman.) Women
          who choose to emotionally process the experience can help facilitate
          the release and completion of the pregnancy.

        <Text>
          During the waiting stage, after some time, if there were nausea and
          breast tenderness, they will usually stop, and gradually, you may
          start experiencing uterine and back pain (similar to menstrual
          cramps), contractions, and uterine discomfort. All of these are signs
          that something is happening in the womb. Each woman’s body is
          different; not all will experience the same symptoms or in the same
          order. Just like in the stages of labor, there will be differences
          between women, both in how the miscarriage progresses and in its
          duration.

          The process will continue with the appearance of blood spots on
          underwear or toilet paper, marking the start of the spotting stage.
          These spots are likely to be brown, resembling old blood. The spotting
          can last for a day or even a week. Some believe that most miscarriages
          occur on the third day of spotting, but this is not guaranteed for
          everyone. As mentioned, each woman’s body is unique.

          The process will continue to develop, and at some point, the bleeding
          will become fresh red blood, increasing in intensity, similar to
          menstrual blood. You may experience contractions and abdominal pain
          coming from the uterus, resembling menstrual cramps. The active
          bleeding begins to push out most of the pregnancy (the gestational
          sac, fetus, or placenta), marking the beginning of the active
          miscarriage stage.

          In all stages, it’s important to pay attention to your mood. Keep in
          mind that hormones are still in your blood and affect your emotional
          and physical state, much like before childbirth. Feelings of
          helplessness, fear, anticipation, pain, loss, and regret all have a
          place. Give yourself space to feel and express the full range of
          emotions you're experiencing. You may feel the need to retreat and
          connect inward.

          The Relief After the Miscarriage

        <Text mt={2}>
          After the central part of the pregnancy is released, you will
          typically experience immediate relief. If there are still discomforts,
          bleeding, or pain, it may indicate that some tissue remains in the
          uterus. Sometimes, the remaining tissue is the placenta, the part
          where the pregnancy implanted in the uterine wall.
        </Text>
        <Text mt={2}>
          If not all the contents have been expelled and residual tissue
          remains, a second wave of the miscarriage may occur. This second wave
          can fully release the remaining tissue or reduce it. Another
          possibility is that the remaining tissue will be expelled with the
          first menstrual period or subsequent periods. You can help your body
          empty the uterus completely through movement and womb care at home. If
          needed, medical assistance can be sought to remove the remaining
          tissue through a procedure called a hysteroscopy.

          Throughout the miscarriage process, it's recommended to stay under

        <Text mt={2}>
          After the process, it's important to rest, similar to the postpartum
          period, to regain your strength. The first menstrual period will
          typically arrive between 4 to 8 weeks after the active miscarriage,
          often preceded by ovulation. Afterward, it's advisable to check the
          condition of the uterus to ensure everything has been fully released.

          There are warning signs of infection that you should be aware of:
          rising fever, feeling generally unwell, foul-smelling discharge from
          the uterus, continuous pain in the uterus, stabbing sensations,
          persistent pressure without relief (in the lower abdomen near the
          pubic bone and upwards), or chills. If you experience one or more of
          these symptoms, it's important to get checked urgently. As the saying
          goes, "when in doubt, there is no doubt!" You should immediately seek
          medical evaluation. Each of these signs is a red flag, and you should
          see a doctor. Even if you simply feel that something is wrong and
          you're concerned, it’s always better to check. If necessary, the
          doctor will confirm that everything is proceeding naturally, and you
          can continue the process at home. In the case of an infection, a D&C
          (dilation and curettage) procedure is usually performed to empty the
          uterus, and you will receive antibiotics.

          Ways to Prevent Infection
        </Heading>
        <Text>
          Our bodies create the contents of the uterus. The likelihood of the
          body developing an infection from something it has produced is low.
          The cervix protects the uterus from external elements that could cause
          infection, and the body prepares to empty and expel the uterine lining
          naturally.
        </Text>
        <Text mt={2}>
          It’s important to note that infection is a possible but not routine
          occurrence during the natural process of miscarriage, just as it is
          not routine during pregnancy, childbirth, or menstruation. Many women
          fear infection and become alarmed, as our minds often link death with
          decay and filth. In Judaism, blood is associated with both death and
          unfulfilled potential for life. Death is seen as one of the most
          impure things in Judaism, and some believe that when a woman is in
          niddah (during menstruation), she is "impure" and should not be
          touched. In our subconscious and cultural messages, death, impurity,
          and fear are intertwined. It’s important to try not to get caught up
          in these thought patterns.

          The active miscarriage stage is characterized by bleeding of fresh
          blood and blood clots. Blood loss is a normal part of the process,
          whether it's a natural expulsion or accelerated with Cytotec. However,
          sometimes the blood loss can be excessive and severe, potentially
          leading to loss of consciousness and life-threatening situations.
          Life-threatening blood loss can develop during the active miscarriage
          stage when the uterus attempts to expel its contents. Even if the

          As previously mentioned, every miscarriage, like every childbirth, has
          its own course. There are short and quick miscarriages, and there are
          prolonged ones. Sometimes the gestational sac may be expelled, but the
          placenta remains, or some content may be expelled while other content
          remains in the uterus. It is important to ensure that the residual
          tissue does not cause persistent heavy bleeding.

          If you are feeling well and there is no excessive bleeding but you

          natural process of expulsion. Not everything may be expelled in the
          first round. It is normal for a miscarriage to occur in two or more
          stages, and typically some waiting is required. It can also be helpful
          to assist yourself with self-care. Sometimes, residual tissue in the
          uterus is the way the uterus protects itself and is also connected to

          Waiting for the menstrual blood to help complete the expulsion of
          pregnancy tissue allows the body time to hormonally stabilize, rebuild
          the uterine lining, and reach the stage of menstrual bleeding. The

          intervention like medication, contractions and bleeding can be heavy,

          The Connection
        </Heading>
        <Text mb={2}>
          The connection between our physical body, mind, soul, and energy is
          reflected in our physical symptoms. A miscarriage is a physical event,
          but our experience of it is also influenced by our emotional and
          mental state. Often, I've seen women who waited a significant time for
          their body to hormonally prepare to release the pregnancy, but
          bleeding didn't intensify or the uterus didn't fully clear.
        </Text>
        <Text mt={2}>
          In such cases, it's important to explore what might be "holding on" to
          the pregnancy. Consider your beliefs, thoughts, and feelings about the
          pregnancy, your body, your life, and the miscarriage.

        <Text mt={2}>
          You can communicate with the soul that didn't continue or reflect on
          your feelings about it. Engage in physical and emotional release
          through sharing with a partner, family, friends, or your close
          environment for support. A partner can provide the space you need.
          Consider listening to guided imagery together, creating art, planning
          and performing a farewell ritual with loved ones, and even discussing
          with children if appropriate.

          Miscarriages within the family context are events that affect
          everyone, even if they aren't openly discussed. However, it's
          beneficial to address and talk about the topic in a way that allows
          for shared coping. It's easier to handle something that is openly
          discussed and processed, with tangible expressions, rather than a
          concept or energy that is in the air but remains unspoken and
          influential.

          It's also important to consider informing your workplace about your

          deserve. Of course, this may not be appropriate for everyone, and not
          all workplaces or families may be open to sharing such experiences.
          However, we should strive for a supportive and empathetic environment,
          allowing ourselves to be gentle and accepting of life changes and
          ourselves, both in public and in places where we need support.

          Farewell Ceremony from the Soul

        <Text mt={2}>
          A pregnancy with a fetal heartbeat indicates that, in addition to the
          physical bodies of the mother and fetus, there was also the presence
          of another spiritual entity. Not everything in our world is made from
          materials that can be touched or seen. The energy of things can be
          just as powerful, if not more so, than their physical manifestations.
          While atomic, magnetic, electrical, and solar energies are widely
          accepted as real and impactful, many people are hesitant to treat the
          energies of people, entities, and souls as factual, due to their
          intangible and non-physical nature.

          After a miscarriage, engaging in physical rituals such as collecting
          blood in a bowl and burying the contents with a farewell ceremony,
          writing a poem, or creating a drawing can be profoundly comforting.
          Building a memorial space provides tangible ways to cope with grief
          and loss. Dealing with something physical is often easier than
          managing abstract concepts or invisible ideas. Even women who undergo
          dilation and curettage (D&C) or suction can request the contents of
          their uterus and conduct a burial ceremony. Allowing space for the
          experience and expressing all arising emotions can help prevent
          repression and provide closure.

          Statements like "It's not the end of the world," "You'll get pregnant

          On some level, we all experience natural or induced miscarriages,
          difficult births, or stillbirths, as well as wonderfully successful
          pregnancies. Unfortunately, patriarchal society has often deemed
          anything less than "perfect" as unworthy. What has been labeled as
          failure is, in fact, part of the whole. It's crucial for women and
          girls to learn that "the womb is the creative center of our bodies,
          with its own significance and value beyond its potential to bear
          children" (Dr. Christiane Northrup, Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom).

          A Short Backstory
        </Heading>
        <Text mb={2}>
          I was a young mother to my first child, filled with excitement and
          love. I trusted my body and cherished it, especially after an
          empowering home birth that resulted in the birth of my healthy
          firstborn son.
        </Text>
        <Text mb={2}>
          About a year later, I wanted to get pregnant again, to expand my heart
          and family, and to give Ori(my son) a sibling. When Ori was a year and
          a half old, I conceived for the second time. At eight weeks, the
          heartbeat stopped, and at twelve weeks, the pregnancy ended in a
          miscarriage, leaving me with sorrow and confusion. The next pregnancy
          also ended in a natural miscarriage. Both times, I was left without
          enough information or emotional support. I felt sad, empty, and very
          lonely in the loss I experienced.
        </Text>
        <Text mb={2}>
          I didn’t have the language to explain what was happening to my body or
          what I needed. My encounters with professionals offered me only
          technical, "cold" data, directing me toward conventional medical
          solutions. I didn’t encounter empathy, listening, or comfort for my
          emotions and fears, and mostly felt there was no one to accompany me
          through the process. A miscarriage is not just the moment the
          pregnancy leaves the womb; often, that’s when the journey truly
          begins.

          Out of the confusion, loneliness, and distress I felt, I embarked on a
          journey of gathering and learning. It was important to me to provide
          other women with support, information, and a guiding hand along their
          way. Before me was the image of the "Red Tent," which in ancient times
          provided a source of support and a comforting space for women, where
          the foundations of feminine wisdom and the ancient tradition of
          motherhood were passed down.

        <Text mb={2}>
          In those days, miscarriage was part of the fertility cycle for many
          women. They would witness and experience both births and miscarriages
          of women in their community, just as they would be present for the
          first menstruation of young girls. Today, in much of modern life,
          women do not share these experiences together like they did in the
          days of the "Red Tent." There's a certain silence around these
          experiences, creating a sense that each woman is on her own.

          "Don't announce the pregnancy until you've passed the first
          trimester"—this advice is often given to "protect" women in case of a
          miscarriage. As a result, when a pregnancy is lost, women are left
          with their secret and their loneliness.
        </Text>

        <Text mb={2}>
          From deep study and my own experience of the loneliness a woman feels
          when she realizes, for various reasons, that she is about to part from
          the pregnancy within her, I developed the approach by which I treat
          and train other professionals to work.

          The "Active Miscarriage Approach" does not aim to negate medical
          solutions but rather to provide a complementary, supportive space

          environment that accompanies her on her unique path.

        <Text mb={2}>
          The term "miscarriage" is broad and does not specify the range of
          situations in which a pregnancy ends without a viable baby. I realized
          that many women lack the words to describe their situation or
          articulate their needs. Is the miscarriage intentional or spontaneous?
          Has the pregnancy ended without physical signs? Has the womb emptied,
          but remnants remain?

          This stage encompasses various experiences, where the primary need is
          to adapt to the understanding that something is ending. It's important
          to allow emotional space for these feelings and time to adjust.
          Alongside the emotional turmoil, a significant aspect that will emerge

          It took me time to recognize and name this stage, as there is a
          tendency to shorten it with medical interventions and hasten the
          emptying of the uterus. This is a time that requires dedication to
          processing grief and loss, allowing space for farewell and digestion.
          The waiting stage varies from miscarriage to miscarriage and from
          woman to woman, depending on the nature of the process, and in some
          cases, there may be no waiting period at all.

          spotting stage varies and may not be significant for everyone. In a
          natural miscarriage, when the loss is processed and the woman is
          waiting for the completion, this stage may be marked by anticipation
          of the expected process. In cases where the woman was unaware of the
          loss, the spotting stage may merge with the announcement stage.

          This stage acknowledges that not all miscarriages will have this

          This stage parallels postpartum recovery. In cultures where support

          Stage 7: First Menstruation
        </Heading>
        <Text mb={2}>
          The arrival of the first menstruation marks the closure of the cycle
          and the beginning of a new menstrual month. After a miscarriage, the
          first period may be different and can complete the process of physical
          and emotional recovery. This stage may not occur after every
          miscarriage, as some women may conceive a new pregnancy during the
          ovulation before their first period. It's important to view
          menstruation as part of the completion process to normalize the
          cyclical movement and acknowledge that remnants before menstruation
          are possible.
        </Text>
        <Text mb={2} mt={5}>
          The stages I’ve outlined are broad milestones through which one can
          view the process. However, it's important to remember that each woman
          and each miscarriage may have its own personal and unique journey,
          much like each childbirth has its own character.
        </Text>
        <Text mb={2}>
          Another foundational aspect of my approach is the understanding that a
          miscarriage provides an opportunity for a deep connection with the
          womb and a chance to work with and support fertility. When a woman
          actively chooses the path that is right for her, based on her
          knowledge and understanding of herself, it allows for a more
          personalized and supportive experience.
